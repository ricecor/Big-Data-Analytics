# Big-Data-Analytics
Two projects taking in big data and analyzing it with python. Collecting different stats from two different data sets using numpy, pandas, sklearn, and matplotlib.

# Diabetes Data
This big data set collected attributes of thousands of people to see if there was any correlations or connections between people with and without diabetes.

Used numpy, pansa, sklearn, and matplotlab to interpret and visualize the data.

# Movie Sales
This big data set had the highest grossing films, each month, of all time. The goal with this data set was to organize the total sales in that year, convert all of the films to have matching inflation from 2019, and total tickets sold to see what the mean, median, and mode of the films and which films truly sold the most.

This script used numpy for all of the formatting and math and pandas to import and manipulate the data set
